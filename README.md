# The-Weapon

Automated macOS desktop to spam iMessage. Interacts with keystrokes via applscript in order to type. ONLY USABLE ON MAC.

It was decided to use keystrokes to send messages as oppose to interacting directly with messages in order to make the application more scalable; this way the spam can be used on any ui text field.

The application will take input for the interval between sending messages, the amount of specific messages, and the number of rounds for those specific messages. For this reason: total messages = [(# specific messages) * (# rounds)].

When the application runs, it will open a pages document called "Exit Strategy", so if the user wants to cease the spam, he/she can click to that document. The user must enter the pages document's path manually in the code (line 203 in AppDelegate.applescript). It will also automatically open the messages application if it's not open already. 

Last important note: This application requires permission access to the messages application; it should give a prompt message explaining this. Make sure to grant access.
